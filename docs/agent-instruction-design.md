# Agent instruction design decisions

Reviewed on 2026-09-16 against template commit
`13588bffe9894bad57c9d96ee6fff5b462a29c0b`. This is dated provenance for instruction
maintenance, not startup context or a claim of measured model improvement.
[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) remains the policy owner; vendored skill bytes, their
source pin, application code, dependencies, and CI policy are unchanged.

## Adaptations and limits

| Source | Adopted here | Deliberately not imported |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Matt Pocock: writing for agents | Conditional context pointers, observable completion, one owner per rule, on-demand references | A copied writing framework in every task; arbitrary prose or line-count gates |
| Matt Pocock: code review | Separate requirements and standards/contracts questions, fixed scope, independent review when tools exist | Mandatory tracker setup or a new spec; automatic defects from subjective code smells; simulated subagents |
| Matt Pocock: TDD | Behavioral boundaries, independent expectations, small vertical slices, reproduction before repair where feasible | User approval before every test; forced TDD for documentation or read-only work |
| Alibaba OpenCodeReview | Complete file accounting, related-file grouping, relevant rules, current anchors, separate falsification of findings | Installing OCR or its runtime; claiming language instructions provide its deterministic guarantees or benchmark results |
| OpenAI: evaluating skills | Natural requests, explicit/implicit/negative controls, traces, outcome checks before cost, repeatable comparisons | Keyword matching as a behavioral pass; paid model runs in normal CI; invented token or latency improvements |
| OpenAI: rethinking skills and prompts | Compact root policy, selective activation, completion through repair, autonomy within authority | Model-name-specific commands or permissions; a mandatory long workflow on small changes |

The original root already had selective reading, small verification boundaries,
offline pinned skills, and honest unavailable-evidence rules. Those are preserved,
not presented as newly invented. Added mechanisms address review scope/precision
and evaluation observability. The review document is local guidance rather than
a seventeenth vendored skill; this preserves the upstream integrity contract.

A real review uses tools to select a snapshot and inspect evidence. The review
instructions cannot enforce file coverage or prevent malicious tool execution by
themselves. Likewise, the evaluation helper validates a catalog and summarizes
traces; it does not create all controlled fixtures, run models, or certify behavior.
The [evaluation protocol](agent-evaluation.md) states those boundaries explicitly.

The GitHub files below were read as references; their implementation and prose
were not vendored. File blob identities identify the inspected contents even if
the linked default branch later moves.

Changing this record does not authorize a skill refresh, external installation,
publication, or additional user workflow. Behavioral evaluation remains NOT RUN
until actual case results and their evidence have been recorded.
